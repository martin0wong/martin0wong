# Hi, Martin here

I'm currently a second-year student at the [University of British Columbia (Vancouver)](https://ubc.ca), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Statistics.

I'm currently exploring the various fields in Computer Science and building up my technical stack.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin0wong/), or at <takyuenwong.martin@gmail.com>.

- Fun fact: I'm currently a lyric curator at [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/), started contributing to lyrics, syncing and translation in 2021.
