# Hi, Martin here
### Sometimes you will see me with part of my first name on the Internet

I'm currently a first-year student at the [University of British Columbia (Vancouver)](https://ubc.ca), pursuing a Bachelor in Science.

I'm currently exploring the various fields in Computer Science as they are all fascinating and impactful on the world (we are as reliant on the Internet as oil currently).

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin0wong/), or at <takyuenwong.martin@gmail.com>.

- Fun fact: I'm currently a lyric curator at [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/), started contributing to lyrics, syncing and translation in 2021.
