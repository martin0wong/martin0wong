# Hi, Martin here

I'm currently a second-year student at the [University of British Columbia (Vancouver)](https://ubc.ca), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Statistics.

I'm currently exploring the various fields in Computer Science as they are all fascinating and impactful on the world, with an interest in backend development and data handling to storage.

Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin0wong/), or at <takyuenwong.martin@gmail.com>.

- Fun fact: I'm currently a lyric curator at [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/), started contributing to lyrics, syncing and translation in 2021.
